## WeatherAPI- [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

### Summary 
Created a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. 
For this project I utilized a [simple Python library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citipy), the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api), and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across cities. 

* Analysis performed using Jupyter notebook
* Matplotlib to build plots 


### Scatter Plots build on the following relationships:
* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
